		<h4>Steps</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>
				In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over
				medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste,
				tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
				seasoning, 1 tsp salt, pepper, and 2 tbsp parsley. Simmer, covered, for
				about 1 1/2 hrs, stirring occasionally.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Cook lasagna noodles
				in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes, Drain noodles, and rinse with cold
				water. In amixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining
				parsley, and 1/2 tsp salt.
			</li>
			<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F(190 degrees C)</li>
			<li>
				To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x3 inch
				baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with
				one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella
				cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 meat sauce over mozzarella , sprinkle with
				1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining
				mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Cover with foil(to prevent
				sticking:either spray foil with cooking spray or male sure the foil does
				not touch the cheese.)

				additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
